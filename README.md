# Labrynth-Crawler
A very very small-scale game about making your way through a procedurally-sized labrynth with a bunch of different types of rooms. 

## Items
There is a specific amount of Items that must spawn each round. They will be scattered around the rooms, so if there's a lot of rooms it'll be difficult to find any items.

## Room Generation
Room generation is very much random - there may be thousands of rooms generated, or less than 10, depending on how the generation works out.

## Insanity
During your roam in the Labrynth, you'll have "Special Encounters" that'll cause you to lose Sanity. You must manage your Sanity by keeping yourself calm in order to prevent losing the game.
